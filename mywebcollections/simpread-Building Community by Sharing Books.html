											</a><p>When families walk into any bustling
Los Angeles Police Department
station to report a crime,
they pass a brightly painted box
full of children’s books. Kids poke through the
collection and sneak in a fairy tale while their
parents speak to officers working the front
desk. The books offer a welcome distraction
for children and a healthy buffer against further
trauma. The precinct libraries are just
one arm of the <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://littlefreelibrary.org/community/">Kids, Community &amp; Cops</a>
program run by Todd Bol and his nonprofit,
<a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://littlefreelibrary.org/">Little Free Library</a> (LFL).</p>

<p>Bol’s mom was a schoolteacher and
loved putting books into children’s hands.
In 2009, Bol built in her honor a box that
resembled a miniature schoolhouse out of an
old garage door in his Hudson, Wisconsin,
front yard. He filled it with books he wanted
to share with neighbors and hung a sign:
“free books.” A year later, he held a garage
sale. But instead of buying his old stuff,
people took selfies next to his little library.
So he built and gave away 30 more.</p>

<p>Today, more than 60,000 Little Free
Libraries stand around the world, in all 50
states and in 80 countries. The organization
estimates that people share 43.8 million
books through LFLs each year and expects
the number of libraries to reach 100,000
this year. Most sit in people’s front yards,
just like Bol’s first miniature schoolhouse.</p>

<p>“The libraries took off because it made
local heroes and because it brought people
together,” Bol says. “People discover the
Little Free Library and it makes neighbors
feel good about themselves.” Each little library
has a shingle on its tiny door that says, “Take a book—return a book.” The organization
encourages volunteer librarians,
called stewards, to pay $40 to register their
libraries in the LFL network and to receive
an engraved charter sign.</p>

<p>Essential to LFL’s philosophy is a lack
of rules and restrictions. Stewards can buy
or build and decorate their libraries to suit
their fancy, they can curate their book collections
any way they choose, and they can
plug into the larger LFL community online.
“It’s everybody’s canvas,” Bol says.
“Everybody gets to use it the way they want
in every neighborhood.”</p>

<p>LFL’s success in inspiring a love of reading
and building community has earned
it several honors, including the National
Book Foundation’s <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/http://www.nationalbook.org/innovations_in_reading_2013_littlefreelibrary.html#.WnoBBa6nGpo">Innovations in Reading
Prize</a>, Library Journal’s <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2013/03/people/movers-shakers-2013/todd-bol-rick-brooks-movers-shakers-2013-innovators/#_">Movers &amp; Shakers
Award</a>, the Library of Congress <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://littlefreelibrary.org/loc/">Literacy
Award</a>, and <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://littlefreelibrary.org/little-free-library-named-top-rated-nonprofit/">“Top-Rated Nonprofit” status</a>
by GreatNonprofits.</p>

<p>“Little Free Library offers an opportunity
for students to have greater access to
books in their homes and neighborhoods,”
says Michael Todd, the national director of
marketing and communications for <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://readingpartners.org/?gclid=CjwKCAiAweXTBRAhEiwAmb3Xu07Oj-_oGH4nkfm_fqeDYm3o6zw7MDxC1voP9ClcUQXgqFd67zIffBoC1EIQAvD_BwE">Reading
Partners</a>, a national nonprofit that mobilizes
community volunteers to work one-on-one
with struggling readers. “The more opportunities
students have to read and explore
books, and the more awareness they have of
the importance of literacy, the greater their
chances for future success.”</p>

<h3 class="title" id="sr-toc-0">Building A Network</h3>

<p>Scrolling through photos of Little Free
Libraries on Instagram feels like flipping
the pages of a magical children’s book.
“We love to share photos of unique Little
Free Libraries from around the world and
showcase the creativity of their stewards,
who have made Little Libraries that look
like everything from rocket ships and robots
to tugboats, Victorian mansions,
movie theaters, and more,” says Margret
Aldrich, who works on LFL’s media and
programming. She retweets and reposts
photos that friends and fans share on their
personal Twitter and Instagram accounts.</p>

<p>She also shares moving testimonials from
individuals who have received no-cost LFLs
through the organization’s Impact Library
Program. In one post from Columbus, Ohio,
Anya Trujillo reported that she hears gunshots
at night and finds used shell casings
sprinkled on the sidewalk. But she’s noticed
a change since LFL donated a nearby book
box. She sees neighbors stand around their
Little Free Library and chat as they browse
through books. “It’s an overall tool bringing
the neighborhood together,” she says.</p>

<p>Articles about LFL pop up in newspapers
and on blogs and radio shows about
40,000 times a year. But the picturesque
libraries’ popularity actually may pose a
challenge for the organization. “The clear
risk of Little Free Library’s approach is that
others can adopt the core concept without
joining the community, which could over
time dilute our strong identity,” says Jeremy
Hillman, director of corporate communications
for the World Bank Group and a Little
Free Library board member. Still, the team
chooses not to assert copyright over other,
similar grassroots book-sharing communities.
“As an organization that is passionate
about spreading the values of literacy, community
building, and creativity, we welcome
this organic growth whilst we balance the
need to maintain a viable national, and now
global, presence,” Hillman says.</p>

<p>To help maintain its brand identity, the
LFL team has worked to strengthen the
value of membership for stewards who pay
to register their libraries with the organization,
Hillman says. Little Free Library now
hosts book giveaways, free downloads, and
other special offers on its private Facebook
group, where stewards from all over can
connect with each other. “It’s a perk for us
to have such an easy communication channel
with our stewards, too,” Aldrich says, “as
we’re able to bounce ideas off of these folks
who are often our most valuable advisors
and champions.”</p>

<p>Stewards meet others online with whom
they would otherwise never cross paths:
a lower-income family in Cleveland, a
well-off retiree in San Francisco, a school
administrator in New Orleans, a police officer
in Minneapolis, a community organizer
in Italy. An active member of the Facebook
group from Sudan named Malaz recently
posted that she is establishing a thousand
LFLs in her home country.</p>

<h3 class="title" id="sr-toc-1">From Products to Partnerships</h3>

<p>Unlike most nonprofits, LFL runs almost
exclusively on earned income. The organization
hires woodworkers in Minnesota and
Wisconsin to handcraft high-quality, beautiful
LFLs. Sales of these libraries, charter
signs, and related products account for about
95 percent of annual revenue and fund a $2.6
million operating budget, supporting other
LFL initiatives such as the Impact Library
Program and Kids, Community &amp; Cops.</p>

<p>The organization also receives occasional
grants for specific projects. But with a staff
of only 11, Bol says he’s struggled to find
time to seek out funding and plans to hire
consultants to help. Fielding proposals from
philanthropists who reach out keeps him
busy enough, he says.</p>

<p>One grant from the Hudson Hospital
Foundation, however, has already helped
launch a set of LFLs focused on health literacy
in the Hudson, Wisconsin, school system.
The partnership with the foundation
and the local school district supports a set
of physical libraries, a selection of books,
and a set of health-focused Action Book
Clubs modeled after LFL’s Action Book
Club Program, which combines reading
with community service.</p>

<p>Bol and Aldrich hope that such initiatives
will help attract more donors and partners;
ultimately, Bol wants 60 percent of the budget
to come from earned income and 40
percent from donations. Boosting donations
will be important as the nonprofit continues
to expand its focus from distributing
physical products to building partnerships
and community programs, says LFL board
member Margaret Bernstein.</p>

<p>Many of these partnerships and programs
are already showing success. Los
Angeles police report that since the launch
of the Kids, Community &amp; Cops program,
many children who have visited an LFL in an
LAPD station have joined the department’s
free Cadet Program and Police Activities
League, where officers mentor young people
on issues ranging from health to finance to
community service. Some parents also now
volunteer at the stations. In December, the
LAPD and LFL began stocking squad cars
with books provided by local nonprofits that
cops can give kids while patrolling.</p>

<p>“Our goal through youth programs is
to expose children to opportunities that
they would not have otherwise, based on
their circumstances,” says LAPD Sergeant
Heidi Stoecklein, who runs the department’s
Community Safety Partnership Program in
the Newton area. “The Little Free Library
shares the same vision, and we are so thankful
for their partnership to ensure children
have access to books and are building positive
relationships with the community and
police officers.”</p>

<p>Girl Scouts have also <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://littlefreelibrary.org/scouts/">teamed up</a> with
LFL and built more than 500 Little Libraries
in their communities—an activity that now
earns scouts a patch. Additionally, about
600 public libraries around the country use
LFLs as catalysts for community outreach.
In California, the Monterey County Public
Library system has set up 29 mini branches
in neighborhoods that are far from a public
library. Obviously, LFLs cannot offer all the
services that public libraries do, but they can
complement them, Aldrich says.</p>

<p>Now LFL’s executive director, Todd Bol
didn’t grow up a reader. He struggled with
dyslexia, and spelling bees brought tears to
his eyes. When he accepted the Women’s
National Book Association Second Century
Prize in front of a crowd in New York City
last summer, he held up his second-grade
report card. He had earned an “E” in spelling,
and that E didn’t stand for “excellent.”
“I didn’t come out at the end like a star, but
I came out pretty well,” he says, laughing. “A
Little Free Library can be a spark for a kid,
one boy, one girl. We can encourage their
parents and their neighborhood, and capture
their wisdom and their creativeness. And it
enriches all of us.”</p>
